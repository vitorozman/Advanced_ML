# Advanced ML

This is the repository of the Advanced Machine Learning course at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics. 


The course was in Slovenian language, which is why the lab exercises (slo. vaje) and homework (slo. domaƒça naloga - DN) are in Slovenian.


The taught topics are
- Recap of ML (sklearn) 
- Meta-learning (openml, hyperopt)
- Learning from Data streams
- Complex data types (node2vec, Word2Vec)
- Introduction to Deep learning (torch)
